Optic Disc Segmentation in Fundus Image using Blue Channel and Simple Thresholding Method

The optic disc (OD) is the nerve center of the eye entering the
retina and also where all the nerves in the eye meet.
The optic disc is also the reference of the features in the image produced by the fundus camera.
in the image produced by the fundus camera. Separation of
normal anatomy is sometimes necessary in detecting
abnormalities in the eye. OD detection is needed to
distinguish it from a bright lesion or exudate that
also share similar visual characteristics with
OD. Imaging using a fundus camera
is a common clinical procedure used to
record the retina for observation [3]. Therefore
Therefore, it is important to perform image segmentation in OD to
explain the condition of the patient's eye as normal
or abnormal.
